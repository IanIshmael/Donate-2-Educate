              I am a mother of two and student at the DU Full-stack coding
              bootcamp. On my free time I enjoy studying child development and
              and learning how to code. Donate-2-Educate is a project that I
              feel both emotionally and intellectually attached to because of
              the potential impact it could have on educational instructions and
              our community as a whole. Thank you for reading!

              I am a father of 3, a wicked awesome husband, and a
              self-proclaimed nerd. I decided to take up coding as a way to
              break out into a new career. I love this project and think it is a
              wonderful opportunity to help give back to the community by
              increasing our ability to invest in our children.

              Former child turned student of the DU Full-stack coding bootcamp,
              I enjoy the outdoors and exploring the world every chance I get.
              D2E is an exciting opportunity to connect people with their local
              schools and give an outlet to make a meaningful contribution to
              the development of the next generation and build the future of
              tomorrow!

              I have just graduated highschool and decidied the next step is to
              go down the coding path. Some of my favorite hobbies are
              playing/listening music and being a film nerd. The reasoning to
              why I wanted to work this passion project is not only to work with
              amazing/talented people but to help schools and teachers that
              could really benfit from donated supplies.
